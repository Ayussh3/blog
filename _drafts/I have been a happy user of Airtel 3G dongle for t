I have been a happy user of Airtel 3G dongle for the past couple of years. I recently upgraded my MacBook to Yosemite, and the dongle stopped working!
The dialer software that ships with the dongle isn't compatible with Yosemite. It internally uses Apple's USB modem which is a 32bit software. Yosemite is 64bit.
