   bio: "Shireesh heads technology at eLitmus. He is generally curious about things, especially technology.
      His curiosity almost cost him his first job when he hacked into a customer's system to gain unauthorized internet 
      access (mid '90s). He was lucky, his employer saw this as a potential rather than a threat."

   bio: "This Bobba is the same guy who once partnered with Forrest Gump to start a Shrimp business and made millions. 
         He and Gump invested their money in a company named Apple, which they thought was in fruit business. 
         The rest, as they say, is history"
